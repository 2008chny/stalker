TODO:
=====

 * All the attributes that has a back reference on other objects should reset
   the back reference value to Null or to the default value whenever they are
   set to None or empty list. For example, when the Project objects sequences
   attribute is set to an empty list or None, the referring Sequence objects
   project attribute should be set to None, also there are tons of this kind of
   relations in the system. SQLAlchemy handles them automatically but Stalker
   should do it too, to allow others who are not willing to use SQLAlchemy as
   their ORM to be able to have this property automatically.


DONE:
=====

 * for an object which stores a list of other objects, stalker is validating if
   the list is gathered from the correct type of objects, for example,
   StatusList objects only accepts a list of Status objects. Stalker is able to
   check if the elements in a list are Status objects when a list is assigned
   to the StatusList.statuses attribute, but it can not check anything if the
   list element is changed individually afterwards. This behaviour should be
   extended with a validating system which is able to track changes on list
   elements.
   
   SOLUTION:
     
     Added the ValidatedList list variant which does all the necessary things
     explained in the problem.
