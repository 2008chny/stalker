How To Contribute
*****************

Stalker started as an Open Source project with the expactation of 
contributions. The soul of the open source is to share the knowledge and
contribute.

These are the areas that you can contribute to:
 * Documentation
 * Testing the code
 * Writing the code
 * Creating user interface elements (graphics, icons etc.)

Development Style
=================

Stalker is developed strictly by following TDD practices. So every participant
should follow TDD metadologly. Skipping this steps is highly prohibited. Every
added code to the trunk should have a corresponding test.

Code Style
==========

For the general coding style every participant should strictly follow PEP 8
rules, and there are some extra rules as listed below:
 * There should be 3 spaces between functions and class methods
 * and also there should be 6 spaces before and after a class body

If you are going to add a new python file (*.py), there is an empty py file
with the name empty_code_template_file.py under docs/_static. Before starting
anything, dublicate this file and place it under the folder you want. This
files has the neccessary shebang and the GPL 3 license text.

SCM - Mercurial (HG)
====================

The choice of SCM is Mercurial. Every developer should be familiar with it. It
is a good start to go the selenium mercuial site and doing the tutorial if you
don't feel familiar enough with hg.
